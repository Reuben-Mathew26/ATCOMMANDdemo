Module Chosen: Cavli C42QM
Network:LTE Cat M1/NB-IoT and 2G (GSM) capabilities, along with integrated GNSS and an optional eSIM

Proposed Command:
AT Command 1: AT+QENG="servingcell"

The main purpose of this is to retrieve detailed information about the currently connected serving cell (LTE/WCDMA/GSM), including parameters like RSRP, RSRQ, SINR, PCI, etc.This command is used  to analyze signal quality, network performance, and verify module registration.

Mocked Response:

AT+QENG="servingcell"
+QENG: "servingcell","NOCONN"
+QENG: "servingcell","LTE","FDD",404,45,1A2B3C,78,3850,3,15,15,-92,-10,-67,10
OK

"NOCONN" = No Connection established yet with a cell tower.

AT Command 2: AT+QFPLMNCFG="List"

This  lists Forbidden Public Land Mobile Networks (FPLMN) – networks the module is blocked from connecting to.Used to check or debug network rejection issues due to previous failures or operator policy restrictions.

Mocked Response:
AT+QFPLMNCFG="List"
+QFPLMNCFG: "List",1,"40445"
+QFPLMNCFG: "List",2,"405854"
OK
The module will not try to register on PLMNs 40445 or 405854

AT Command 3: AT+QADC=0
Reads the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) value from port 0. This can be used to monitor external analog sensors (e.g., battery voltage, temperature sensors).

Mocked Response:
AT+QADC=0
+QADC: 0,1234
OK

Port 0 ADC value is 1234 (raw format), which could represent a voltage level depending on ADC resolution and reference voltage.
